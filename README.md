A data exploration was conducted to uncover insights about the current state of the market. Through the use of visualization and charts, we were able to gain a deeper understanding of the trends and patterns that shape the industry. From analyzing the price per square foot of different neighborhoods to identifying the most popular types of properties, this data exploration provided valuable insights for both buyers and sellers alike. By communicating these findings in simple terms to non-coders, we hope to empower individuals to make informed decisions when it comes to investing in Dubai's real estate market
